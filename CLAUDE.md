## ‚úÖ RECENT CRITICAL FIXES - August 2025

### **LATEST** File Count Mismatch Double-Counting Bug - RESOLVED
**Status**: ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED** - August 26, 2025  
**Impact**: Fixes critical statistics bug causing file count discrepancies and missing file validation

**Problem Discovered:**
- User reported 50,703 files processed but only 48,594 actually in target directory (2,109 discrepancy)
- Statistics showed 0 renamed duplicates despite large dataset with duplicate-prone filenames
- Folder creation count showed 0 despite creating 52+ platform directories
- Critical warnings not being logged to summary files

**Root Cause:** Lines 1313 and 1351 - Double-counting bug where renamed files were counted BOTH as renamed AND as copied
```python
# Line 1313: Count as renamed (correct)
folder_renamed += 1
# Line 1351: ALSO count as copied (BUG - double counting!)
folder_copied += 1
```

**Solution Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Double-Counting**: Renamed files no longer counted twice in statistics
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Logging**: Count mismatch warnings now logged to summary files
- ‚úÖ **Complete Statistics Logging**: Final success statistics captured in logs
- ‚úÖ **Improved Display**: Better organized file statistics with total discovered files
- ‚úÖ **Thread Count Update**: Windows default increased from 2 to 3 threads for better performance
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Issue Tracking**: All bugs documented in `.issues/` directory

**Technical Details:**
- Modified line 1351 to exclude renamed files from `folder_copied` count
- Added comprehensive logging for all critical terminal output
- Improved file statistics display organization and clarity
- Updated default thread count based on user testing results

### **PREVIOUS** Duplicate Filename Overwriting Bug - RESOLVED
**Status**: ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED** - August 26, 2025  
**Impact**: Prevents data loss from files with identical names across source folders

**Problem Discovered:**
- Files with same names from different source folders (e.g., `NES-1/game.nes` and `NES-2/game.nes`) were mapping to identical target paths
- Second file would overwrite first file, causing permanent data loss
- User experienced: 50,569 files "organized" but only 48,594 actually in target (1,975 files lost!)

**Root Cause:** Line 1152 - `target_file_path = target_platform_dir / source_path.name` creates identical paths for same filenames

**Solution Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ **Smart Deduplication**: New `get_unique_target_path()` function prevents filename collisions
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Naming**: Extracts hints from source folders (`NES-1` ‚Üí `game (1).nes`, `NES-USA` ‚Üí `game (USA).nes`)
- ‚úÖ **SHA1 Verification**: Still detects and skips truly identical files  
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Statistics**: Tracks renamed files separately from copied/replaced
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Reporting**: Clear breakdown of copied vs renamed vs replaced files
- ‚úÖ **Validation Check**: Counts actual files in target directory and warns of mismatches

**New Features:**
- Folder hint extraction: `"NES-1"` ‚Üí `"1"`, `"NES (Europe)"` ‚Üí `"Europe"`
- Numbered fallback: `game.nes`, `game (2).nes`, `game (3).nes`
- Enhanced logging: All rename decisions logged for transparency
- Post-processing validation: Actual file count verification

### Windows Compatibility Issues - RESOLVED
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED** as of commits 9bcd65a, 15a1743, and 047c61b  
**Impact**: Script now successfully copies files on Windows and Linux instead of reporting "0 files copied"

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Missing Implementation Bug**: `AsyncFileCopyEngine._process_concurrent()` was a placeholder returning empty stats
2. **Unicode Encoding Errors**: Arrow characters (‚Üí) caused `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2192'` on Windows cp1252 console
3. **AttributeError Crashes**: `PerformanceOptimizedROMProcessor` referenced non-existent `self.logger_errors` attribute
4. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Method expected Path objects but received dict structures from `_group_files_by_folder()`
5. **Directory Contention Bug**: Concurrent access to same directories caused 0-byte files and copying failures

**Solutions Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete Concurrent Processing**: Implemented full folder-level threading logic in `_process_concurrent()`
- ‚úÖ **ASCII-Safe Logging**: Replaced all arrow characters (‚Üí) with (->) in subcategory_handler.py
- ‚úÖ **Proper Error Logging**: Added missing `logger_errors` attribute initialization
- ‚úÖ **Dict Structure Handling**: Extract `file_info['path']` and use pre-determined `file_info['platform']`
- ‚úÖ **Folder-Level Threading Architecture**: Prevents directory contention by assigning one thread per source folder
- ‚úÖ **Atomic File Operations**: Copy to temporary files with integrity verification and atomic rename

**Validation Results:**
- ‚úÖ Script syntax validation passes
- ‚úÖ Help command functionality works
- ‚úÖ Analyze-only mode functions properly  
- ‚úÖ Subcategory processor with Unicode fixes works perfectly
- ‚úÖ No encoding errors during execution
- ‚úÖ File copying logic now functional
- ‚úÖ Directory contention eliminated - 0 contention events in testing vs 48+ with old method
- ‚úÖ 100% file integrity validation with checksum verification

## üö® CRITICAL KNOWN ISSUES

### WSL2 Incompatibility - UNRESOLVED
**Status**: ‚ùå **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE**  
**Impact**: Script experiences high I/O error rates (up to 54% failure) when processing ROM collections on WSL2 Windows mounts
**Root Cause**: WSL2's 9p protocol has fundamental limitations with concurrent file operations on Windows drives

**Failed Mitigation Attempts:**
- ‚ùå Threading-based timeout mechanisms (I/O errors persist before timeout triggers)
- ‚ùå Chunked processing with recovery pauses (still experiences high I/O error rates)  
- ‚ùå Single-threaded mode with increased delays (reduced but still significant error rates)
- ‚ùå Enhanced retry logic and atomic copy operations (9p protocol issue, not copy logic)

**CRITICAL FOR DEVELOPMENT**: 
- **DO NOT develop or test on WSL2** - Use native Windows or Linux
- **WSL2 testing will fail** with high I/O error rates on Windows mounts (`/mnt/*`)
- This is a known limitation of WSL2's 9p filesystem protocol for concurrent operations

```

## Development Workflow

### Issue Tracking Requirements - CRITICAL

**MANDATORY**: All identified bugs and multi-step development tasks MUST be tracked systematically:

#### Local Issues Register
- **Create `.issues/LOCAL_ISSUE_*.md` files** for every identified bug or issue
- **Use descriptive names**: `LOCAL_ISSUE_FILE_COUNT_MISMATCH.md`, `LOCAL_ISSUE_DUPLICATE_STATS_BUG.md`
- **Include standard header**:
  ```markdown
  # Issue Title - Local Development Tracking
  **Note**: This is internal development tracking, not a public GitHub issue  
  **Status**: Active/Resolved | **GitHub Issue**: None/Link if exists
  ```
- **Document thoroughly**: Root cause analysis, technical investigation, solution approach
- **Keep all resolved issue files** for historical reference and pattern recognition

#### Task Roadmaps
- **Create `.claude/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name.md` files** for multi-step implementations
- **Update throughout development** with progress, learnings, and context
- **Essential for handoff**: Enable future Claude sessions to continue work seamlessly
- **Include**: Completed tasks, current status, key decisions, technical patterns, gotchas

#### CLAUDE.md Updates
- **Document all critical fixes** in the "Recent Critical Fixes" section
- **Include technical details** sufficient for future development reference
- **Link to issue files** when appropriate for detailed technical analysis

This systematic approach prevents:
- Repeated analysis of the same issues
- Loss of critical technical context between sessions
- Incomplete understanding of past decisions and solutions

### Testing Strategy

python dat_to_shortcode_converter.py "source" "target" --dry-run
python dat_to_shortcode_converter.py "source" "target" --no-interactive

# ‚ö†Ô∏è WSL2 WARNING - DO NOT RUN THESE COMMANDS ON WSL2 (WILL HANG)
# python dat_to_shortcode_converter.py "/mnt/e/ROMs" "/mnt/e/Organized" --debug  # FAILS ON WSL2
# Use Windows Command Prompt instead:
# python dat_to_shortcode_converter.py "E:\ROMs" "E:\Organized" --debug

# Performance and debugging
python dat_to_shortcode_converter.py "source" "target" --subcategory-stats
python good_pattern_handler.py                    # Specialized pattern testing
```

### Pre-commit Workflow

**CRITICAL: Always run these checks before committing:**

1. **‚úÖ Comprehensive validation**: `python test_comprehensive_validation.py` (must show 100% success)
2. **Syntax validation**: `python -m py_compile dat_to_shortcode_converter.py`
3. **Help command test**: `python dat_to_shortcode_converter.py --help`
4. **Debug analysis test**: `python dat_to_shortcode_converter.py "test" "target" --analyze-only --debug-analysis`
5. **Performance validation**: Check logs show 609+ files/second processing speed
6. **Log verification**: Check that logs/ directory functionality works
6. **CLI argument validation**: Test all new argument combinations

### Quality Requirements

**All functionality must work without external dependencies** - The tool's strength is its simplicity and portability.

**Behavioral testing focus:**
- ‚úÖ Test that DAT folders map to correct shortcodes
- ‚úÖ Test that file organization produces expected directory structures  
- ‚úÖ Test that regional preferences work as expected
- ‚ùå Don't test internal function names or implementation details
- ‚ùå Don't test file structure or import statements

### Key Development Patterns

**Three-Tier Platform Detection:**
```python
# STEP 1: Specialized patterns (highest priority)
specialized_result, context = specialized_processor.process(folder_name)
# Examples: GoodNES v3.27 ‚Üí nes, MAME 0.245 ‚Üí arcade

# STEP 2: Subcategory preprocessing  
processed_name, context = subcategory_processor.process(folder_name)
# Example: "Atari Lynx - Games - [LNX] (Retool)" ‚Üí "Atari Lynx"

# STEP 3: Enhanced regex patterns
PLATFORM_MAPPINGS = {
    # Original patterns (preserved)
    r"Nintendo.*Nintendo Entertainment System.*": ("nes", "Nintendo Entertainment System"),
    # NEW: Enhanced patterns for preprocessed names
    r"^Nintendo 64$": ("n64", "Nintendo 64"),
    r"^Atari Lynx$": ("atarilynx", "Atari Lynx"),
    # ...90+ total patterns
}
```

**Logging Architecture:**
```python
# Six different log categories
- operations_*.log    # File operations and decisions
- analysis_*.log      # Platform detection results
- progress_*.log      # Real-time processing updates  
- errors_*.log        # Errors and exceptions
- summary_*.log       # Final statistics
- performance_*.log   # Performance metrics
```

**Performance Monitoring Architecture:**
```python
# Performance tracking with pyinstrument-based optimization
performance_monitor = PerformanceMonitor(logger)
performance_monitor.record_pattern_hit("specialized_good_tools", "nes")
performance_monitor.record_cache_miss("platform_identification")
performance_monitor.log_performance_summary()  # Shows timing metrics
```

**Comprehensive ROM Extensions Database:**
```python
# Research-based ROM format support (70+ extensions)
ROM_EXTENSIONS = {
    # Nintendo Systems  
    '.nes', '.fds', '.nsf', '.unf', '.nez',     # NES/Famicom
    '.sfc', '.smc', '.swc', '.fig', '.bsx', '.st',  # SNES + special

```

### Supported Format Variants
- **N64**: BigEndian, ByteSwapped, Standard
- **NDS**: Encrypted, Decrypted, Standard  
- **Future**: PSP PSN/PSX2PSP variants planned

## Critical Bug Fix - Directory Filter Logic ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue Resolved
**Critical directory filtering bug** that caused "Found 0 supported platforms" despite valid ROM collections.

**Root Cause:** Overly broad directory filter pattern matching any directory with "roms" in parent path:
```python
# ‚ùå BROKEN: Filtered out legitimate ROM directories  
if any("roms" in parent.name.lower() for parent in root_path.parents):
    continue  # Skip directory
```

**Solution:** Precise path comparison using `Path.resolve()` for target directory detection:
```python  
# ‚úÖ FIXED: Only skips exact target directory match
if target_dir and root_path.resolve() == target_dir.resolve():
    directories_skipped_target += 1
    continue
```

### Enhancements Added
- **Comprehensive ROM Extensions**: Expanded from ~25 to 70+ formats based on emulation community research
- **Console Progress Feedback**: Real-time user interface updates during directory scanning
- **Enhanced Debugging Options**: `--debug-analysis` and `--include-empty-dirs` for troubleshooting
- **Clear Empty Directory Messaging**: Clarifies when root source directory is empty vs platform directories

### Validation Results
**User confirmation**: Fixed version successfully detected 7 platforms with 16,674 ROM files from same source that previously showed "0 supported platforms".

### Latest Bug Fix - Missing Platform Support ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Issue:** Atomiswave and Cannonball platforms were showing as "Unknown platforms" despite being valid EmulationStation systems.

**Root Cause:** Missing pattern mappings in `PLATFORM_MAPPINGS` dictionary and display name mappings in `RegionalPreferenceEngine.get_display_name()` method.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added regex patterns for Atomiswave and Cannonball to `PLATFORM_MAPPINGS`
- Added display name mappings to `RegionalPreferenceEngine`
- Research confirmed correct shortcodes: `atomiswave` and `cannonball`

**Result:** Both platforms now correctly detected with proper display names:
- `atomiswave` ‚Üí "Atomiswave Arcade"
- `cannonball` ‚Üí "Cannonball (OutRun Engine)"

## Issue Management: Local vs GitHub

### Local Issues Register vs GitHub Issues

**Local Issues Register** (`.issues/LOCAL_ISSUE_*.md` files):
- Private development tracking for technical analysis and investigation
- Located in `.issues/` folder (ignored by Git for privacy)
- Files named `LOCAL_ISSUE_*.md` to clarify they are internal development tracking
- **Not all local issues become GitHub issues** - many resolved during development
- Track detailed technical analysis, root cause investigation, and solution architecture
- **Keep all resolved issue files** for historical reference and pattern recognition

**GitHub Repository Issues** (public issue tracking):
- Only create GitHub issues for **user-facing problems** or **unresolved critical issues**
- User-focused descriptions without excessive technical details
- Use local issues register as source material for comprehensive technical context
- **Current Status**: Only WSL2 I/O errors issue (#2) is open - correctly reflects actual user impact

### Issue Management Workflow

1. **Research Phase**: Create local `.issues/LOCAL_ISSUE_*.md` file with detailed technical analysis
2. **Assessment**: Determine if issue affects users or can be resolved during development
3. **GitHub Creation**: For user-facing issues, create GitHub issue with user-focused description
4. **Parallel Tracking**: Update local register with technical details, GitHub issue with user updates  
5. **Resolution**: Close GitHub issue when resolved, keep local file for future reference and learning

### Current Issue Status
- **Directory Contention**: ‚úÖ Resolved during development (tracked in `.issues/LOCAL_ISSUE_DIRECTORY_CONTENTION.md`)
- **WSL2 I/O Errors**: üö® Active GitHub issue #2 + detailed analysis in `.issues/LOCAL_ISSUE_WSL2_IO_ERRORS.md`

### Local Issues Register Management
```bash
# Create new local issue tracking file
# File: .issues/LOCAL_ISSUE_[DESCRIPTIVE_NAME].md
# Header template:
# # [Issue Title] - Local Development Tracking
# **Note**: This is internal development tracking, not a public GitHub issue
# **Status**: [Active/Resolved] | **GitHub Issue**: [None/Link if exists]

# View local issues register
ls -la .issues/
cat .issues/LOCAL_ISSUE_*.md
```

### GitHub Issue Commands
```bash
# List all GitHub issues (open and closed)
gh issue list --state=all --limit=20

# View specific GitHub issue details  
gh issue view 2

# Create new GitHub issue (use local register as reference)
gh issue create --title "User-facing Issue Title" --body "User-focused description"

# Update GitHub issue with user-facing progress
gh issue comment 2 --body "Updated status for users: [details]"

# Close resolved GitHub issue
gh issue close 2 --comment "Fixed in commit [hash]"
```

### When to Create GitHub Issues vs Local Tracking

‚úÖ **CREATE GitHub Issue** (public user impact):
- User-reported problems affecting multiple users
- Critical bugs that impact production usage  
- Architectural limitations (like WSL2) that need community awareness
- Feature requests with significant user demand
- Problems that require user workarounds or awareness

‚ùå **ONLY Local Issues Register** (internal development):
- Internal development bugs caught during testing
- Issues resolved within the same development session
- Minor compatibility issues with simple workarounds
- Research or investigation tasks without user impact
- Technical debt or refactoring opportunities
- Performance optimization research
- Architecture exploration and analysis

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Platform Detection Issues (Enhanced Diagnostics)
1. **Run enhanced debugging**: `--analyze-only --debug-analysis --include-empty-dirs` (comprehensive analysis)
2. **Check target directory**: Ensure source != target (creates detection loop)  
3. **Verify ROM extensions**: Check files have recognized extensions from 70+ format database
4. **Check comprehensive logs**: `analysis_*.log` includes three-tier matching results
5. **Validate with test suite**: `python test_phase2_patterns.py` for pattern verification
6. **Coverage analysis**: `python analyze_enhanced_coverage.py` for full coverage report
7. **Specialized pattern testing**: `python good_pattern_handler.py` for Good/MAME patterns
8. **Subcategory diagnostics**: Use `--subcategory-stats` to see preprocessing details

### Performance Issues  
1. Check `performance_*.log` for bottlenecks
2. Monitor thread utilization in logs
3. Consider processing smaller batches
4. Exclude from antivirus real-time scanning

### File Operation Errors
1. Check `errors_*.log` for specific errors
2. Verify target directory permissions
3. Ensure source files aren't locked by other processes
4. Test with dry-run mode first

## Development Notes

### When Adding New Platforms (Phase 2 Process)
1. **Add to PLATFORM_MAPPINGS** with appropriate tier (preprocessed patterns for subcategory-processed names)
2. **Consider specialized handler** - add to `good_pattern_handler.py` if it's a Good tool/MAME pattern
3. **Test comprehensively** - add to `test_phase2_patterns.py` validation suite
4. **Validate coverage impact** - run `analyze_enhanced_coverage.py` to measure improvement
5. **Update documentation** - README.md supported platforms and coverage metrics

### When Enhancing Pattern Matching
1. **Follow three-tier priority** - Specialized ‚Üí Preprocessed ‚Üí Standard patterns  
2. **Maintain 93%+ coverage** - validate with full DAT pattern dataset
3. **Performance monitoring** - ensure sub-millisecond matching for common patterns
4. **Comprehensive testing** - maintain 100% test suite success rate
5. **Backward compatibility** - preserve all existing functionality

### Code Style Guidelines (Phase 2)
- **Modular architecture** - separate specialized handlers from core logic
- **Performance-conscious** - use `PerformanceMonitor` for timing analysis  
- **Comprehensive logging** - include pattern type and confidence in log entries
- **Chain of Responsibility** - maintain preprocessing pipeline modularity
- **Thread safety** - ensure concurrent operations remain safe

## Recent Updates (2025-08-25)

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Critical Bug - Directory-Level Contention in Concurrent File Copying

**Issue:** Concurrent file operations using `shutil.copy2()` in `ThreadPoolExecutor` environment caused race conditions resulting in 0-byte target files and copy failures.

**Root Cause Discovered:** 
- **Location**: `dat_to_shortcode_converter.py` lines 647-887 in `process_files_concurrent()` method
- **Problem**: **Directory-level contention**, not file-level race conditions
- **Architecture Flaw**: Files from ALL folders collected into single flat list, randomly distributed to threads
- **Contention Pattern**: Multiple threads simultaneously accessing same source directory ‚Üí OS-level directory inode locking ‚Üí file system contention

**Evidence from Analysis:**
- 40,051 errors during processing with many 0-byte files
- User confirmed "0-byte files after copying persists"
- Comprehensive test suite confirmed old method creates 48-53 directory contention events
- New folder-level threading approach creates 0 contention events

**Solution Implemented - Folder-Level Threading Architecture:**

1. **‚úÖ Directory Isolation**: Group files by source folder using `defaultdict(list)`
2. **‚úÖ One Thread Per Folder**: Each thread processes exactly one folder sequentially  
3. **‚úÖ Atomic File Operations**: Copy to temporary files with `.tmp` suffix, then atomic rename
4. **‚úÖ 0-Byte Detection**: Size verification with automatic retry on failure
5. **‚úÖ Exponential Backoff**: Retry logic with exponential backoff for I/O errors
6. **‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite validates integrity and thread safety

**New Architecture (Lines 647-887):**
```python
# Group files by source folder to prevent directory contention
files_by_folder = defaultdict(list)
for file_path in all_files:
    source_folder = Path(file_path).parent
    files_by_folder[source_folder].append(file_path)

# Process each folder in its own thread
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=min(len(files_by_folder), self.max_io_workers)) as executor:
    for folder_path, folder_files in files_by_folder.items():
        future = executor.submit(process_folder_files, folder_path, folder_files)
```

**Validation Results:**
- **Directory Contention**: OLD method = 48+ events, NEW method = 0 events  
- **File Integrity**: 100% checksum validation across all test scenarios
- **Thread Safety**: Validated with 4+ concurrent threads, no race conditions
- **Performance**: 60 files copied in 0.08s during stress testing
- **0-Byte Prevention**: Comprehensive detection and retry logic

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETELY RESOLVED
**Impact**: Eliminates all 0-byte file creation and directory contention issues

### Previous Bug Fix - Directory Scanning Logic ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Issue:** Tool was incorrectly processing individual game subdirectories (like "Aero Fighter 2") as potential platforms, causing 310+ "unknown platforms" to be reported.

**Root Cause:** `os.walk()` was recursively scanning ALL directories, including game subdirectories within platform folders.

**Solution Applied:**
- Modified directory scanning to process only top-level directories as potential platforms
- Individual game subdirectories within platforms are now ignored for platform detection 
- ROM files are still counted recursively within each platform directory for statistics
- Updated `dat_to_shortcode_converter.py:628-675` with two-step scanning process

**Result:** Unknown platform count reduced from 310+ to legitimate unrecognized platforms only.

### Enhanced Good Tools Support ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Added 8 new Good Tools platform mappings:**
- `GoodLynx` ‚Üí `atarilynx` (Atari Lynx)
- `GoodMSX1` ‚Üí `msx` (MSX original)
- `GoodMSX2` ‚Üí `msx` (MSX2)
- `GoodNGPx` ‚Üí `ngp` (Neo Geo Pocket/Color)
- `GoodSV` ‚Üí `supervision` (Watara SuperVision)
- `GoodVBoy` ‚Üí `virtualboy` (Nintendo Virtual Boy)
- `GoodVect` ‚Üí `vectrex` (GCE Vectrex)
- `GoodWSx` ‚Üí `wonderswan` (WonderSwan/Color)

**Impact:** Coverage improved from 90.3% to 93.4% (240/257 DAT patterns).

---

**Key principle:** The tool now achieves enhanced production-ready coverage (93.4%) through systematic three-tier pattern matching and comprehensive Good Tools support. Maintain this modular architecture while preserving the simplicity and portability that made it successful.

## Solopreneur Development Workflow (Updated 2025-08-27)

### Single-Branch Development Strategy
**Core Principle**: ALL work happens on `develop` branch - no feature branches

- **Workflow**: main (stable) ‚Üí develop (all active work) ‚Üí main (releases only)
- **No feature branches**: Overhead without benefit for solo development
- **Frequent micro-commits**: Every working change gets committed immediately
- **Feature flags for experiments**: Use environment variables for toggles

```python
# Feature flags in code (already implemented)
FEATURES = {
    'advanced_file_locking': os.getenv('ENABLE_ADVANCED_LOCKING', '0') == '1',
    'enhanced_terminal_display': os.getenv('ENABLE_ENHANCED_DISPLAY', '1') == '1',
    'windows_av_evasion': os.getenv('ENABLE_AV_EVASION', '0') == '1'
}
```

### Task Management with .claude/tasks/
**CRITICAL**: Update task files AFTER EVERY significant change

- **File naming**: `.claude/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name.md`
- **Update frequency**: After creating/merging PRs, discovering issues, making decisions
- **Essential content**:
  - ‚úÖ Completed work with outcomes
  - üîÑ Current status and blockers
  - üìù Important decisions and rationale
  - ‚ö° Technical patterns established
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas and lessons learned

**Example**:
```markdown
# 2025-08-27-windows-fixes.md

## Progress
- ‚úÖ Encoding fixes (UTF-8 startup config)
- ‚úÖ Signal handling (graceful shutdown)
- ‚úÖ File locking (target-side synchronization)
- üîÑ Terminal display (multi-line progress)

## Key Decisions
- Single develop branch (no feature branches)
- Feature flags for experimental code
- SafeFileHandler for log sanitization

## Gotchas
- Windows needs exclusive file creation (O_EXCL)
- Antivirus requires delays between operations
```

### Rapid Prototyping Workflow (Explore ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement)

1. **Explore**: Analyze existing code before changes
   - Use `grep`, `Read`, file discovery tools
   - Understand current implementation
   
2. **Plan**: Outline approach
   - Use `/plan` mode for complex changes
   - Document in task files
   
3. **Implement**: Make changes with frequent commits
   - Micro-commits for every working change
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   
4. **Test**: Run validation
   - Syntax check: `python -m py_compile dat_to_shortcode_converter.py`
   - Help test: `python dat_to_shortcode_converter.py --help`
   - Functional test with small dataset
   
5. **Document**: Update immediately
   - CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
   - CLAUDE.md for development guidance
   - Task files for context preservation

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

Types:
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `feat:` New features  
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `test:` Test additions/changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

### Context Management for Claude Sessions

**Clear context frequently**: Use `/clear` to reset when switching focus
**Keep CLAUDE.md concise**: < 1000 lines, reference external docs
**Session handoff**: Task files are critical for continuity

### Testing Checklist

Before committing:
1. ‚úÖ Syntax validation passes
2. ‚úÖ Help command works
3. ‚úÖ Dry-run mode functions
4. ‚úÖ No encoding errors in logs
5. ‚úÖ CTRL+C shutdown works gracefully
6. ‚úÖ File operations complete without locks

### Issue Tracking

**Local issues**: `.issues/LOCAL_ISSUE_*.md` for technical investigation
**GitHub issues**: Only for user-facing problems or unresolved critical issues
**Pattern**: Research locally ‚Üí Resolve if possible ‚Üí Create GitHub issue if needed

### Windows-Specific Considerations

1. **File Locking**: Use `TargetDirectorySynchronizer` for thread-safe operations
2. **Encoding**: Force UTF-8 at startup, sanitize logs with `SafeFileHandler`
3. **Antivirus**: Add delays between file operations (0.05s default)
4. **Signals**: Handle SIGBREAK in addition to SIGINT/SIGTERM

### Performance Optimization

- **Threading**: Folder-level isolation prevents directory contention
- **Feature flags**: Disable expensive features when not needed
- **Progress updates**: Rate-limited to 0.1s intervals
- **Logging**: Use SafeFileHandler to prevent encoding crashes

### Documentation Maintenance

**README.md**: General project info for all users
**CLAUDE.md**: This file - Claude-specific development guidance
**CHANGELOG.md**: User-facing changes following Keep a Changelog format
**Task files**: Development context and decision history
