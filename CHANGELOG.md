## [Unreleased]

### Fixed - 2025-08-28

#### Critical Windows File Locking Resolution
- **Root Cause Identified**: Windows Defender scanning newly created files caused WinError 32
- **Simple Fix**: Added 100ms delay after copy but before verification
- **Removed Complexity**: Deleted unnecessary TargetDirectorySynchronizer class
- **Feature Flag Cleanup**: Removed confusing `advanced_file_locking` flag

#### Progress State Management
- **Folder Change**: Now uses `.processing_state/` instead of `.claude/tasks/`
- **Optional Save**: Only creates folder when `ENABLE_PROGRESS_SAVE=1` (default OFF)
- **Runtime Fix**: No folders created during normal execution

#### Enhanced Terminal Display
- **Analysis Phase Integration**: Real-time display of excluded/unknown counts during scanning
- **Progress Format**: Shows `[current/total] - ✅ X platforms, ⚠️ Y excluded, ❓ Z unknown`
- **Preserved Statistics**: All counts properly tracked and displayed

#### Graceful Shutdown Improvements
- **Executor Registration**: ThreadPoolExecutor properly registered with shutdown handler
- **Timeout Handling**: Force shutdown if graceful shutdown exceeds 5 seconds
- **Thread Coordination**: Proper cleanup of running threads on CTRL+C

### Fixed - 2025-08-27

#### Windows Compatibility Suite
- **UTF-8 Encoding at Startup**: Force UTF-8 for all I/O operations before any imports
- **SafeFileHandler**: Sanitize log output to prevent charmap encoding errors
- **Console Code Page**: Set Windows console to UTF-8 (chcp 65001) when possible

#### Threading and File Operations
- **Target-Side Synchronization**: Implemented `TargetDirectorySynchronizer` class for thread-safe file operations
- **Windows Antivirus Evasion**: Use exclusive file creation (O_EXCL) with delays for AV scanning
- **Directory-Level Locking**: Prevent multiple threads from accessing same target directory
- **File-Level Locking**: Additional protection against same-file collisions

#### Signal Handling
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Added `GracefulShutdownHandler` for CTRL+C coordination
- **Thread Coordination**: Proper executor shutdown with timeout
- **Progress Preservation**: Save state to `.claude/tasks/resume_state.json` on shutdown
- **Windows SIGBREAK**: Handle Windows-specific signal in addition to SIGINT/SIGTERM

#### Terminal Display
- **Multi-Line Progress**: `AdvancedProgressDisplay` class with comprehensive statistics
- **Real-Time Updates**: Discovery, processing, and statistics on separate display lines
- **Count Validation**: Warning when processed files don't match discovered count

### Added - 2025-08-27

#### Development Infrastructure
- **Feature Flags**: Environment-based toggles for experimental features
- **Single Branch Workflow**: Consolidated to `develop` branch for all active work
- **Solopreneur Best Practices**: Updated CLAUDE.md with rapid prototyping workflow
- **Task Management**: Structured `.claude/tasks/` workflow documentation

### Changed - 2025-08-27

#### Documentation

- **Commit Strategy**: Documented micro-commit approach for rapid development
- **Testing Checklist**: Clear validation steps before committing

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed

#### Threading Errors and CTRL+C Handling - 2025-08-26
- **Threading Type Errors**: Fixed `'str' object has no attribute 'name'` errors flooding terminal during multi-threaded processing
- **Unresponsive CTRL+C**: Added graceful shutdown mechanism with signal handling and progress preservation
- **Root Cause**: Type mismatch in folder path handling and missing signal handler registration
- **Solution**: Path type consistency, defensive handling, Event-based shutdown, thread interruption support

#### File Count Mismatch + Unicode Logging Errors - 2025-08-26
- **File Count Mismatch**: Fixed persistent 1,925 missing files issue (50,519 reported vs 48,594 actual)
- **Unicode Encoding Errors**: Fixed `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character` crashes on Windows
- **Root Cause**: Counter incremented before verification, missing UTF-8 encoding in log handlers
- **Solution**: Post-copy verification, manifest tracking, UTF-8 file logging, Windows path length checking

#### File Count Double-Counting Bug - 2025-08-26
- **Double-Counting**: Fixed renamed files being counted both as renamed AND copied (2,109 file discrepancy)
- **Statistics Issues**: Fixed 0 renamed duplicates despite duplicate-prone filenames in dataset
- **Root Cause**: Lines 1313 and 1351 both incremented counters for same files
- **Solution**: Exclude renamed files from copied count, enhanced logging, improved statistics display

#### Duplicate Filename Overwriting Bug - 2025-08-26
- **Data Loss**: Fixed files with identical names from different folders overwriting each other (1,975 files lost)
- **Root Cause**: `target_file_path = target_platform_dir / source_path.name` created identical paths
- **Solution**: Smart deduplication with `get_unique_target_path()`, folder hint extraction, SHA1 verification

#### Directory Contention Bug - 2025-08-25  
- **Concurrent File Operations**: Fixed race conditions causing 0-byte target files and copy failures
- **Root Cause**: Multiple threads accessing same source directory causing OS-level directory inode locking
- **Solution**: Folder-level threading architecture, atomic file operations, exponential backoff retry logic
- **Impact**: Eliminated 48-53 directory contention events, achieved 0 contention with new method

#### Windows Compatibility Issues - 2025-08-25
- **Missing Implementation**: Fixed placeholder `_process_concurrent()` method returning empty stats
- **Unicode Encoding**: Replaced arrow characters (→) with ASCII (->) to prevent cp1252 errors
- **AttributeError**: Fixed missing `self.logger_errors` attribute in `PerformanceOptimizedROMProcessor`
- **Data Structure**: Fixed dict structure handling for Path objects in threading methods

#### Directory Filter Logic Bug - 2025-08-25
- **Platform Detection**: Fixed "Found 0 supported platforms" despite valid ROM collections
- **Root Cause**: Overly broad filter pattern matching any directory with "roms" in parent path
- **Solution**: Precise path comparison using `Path.resolve()` for target directory detection only

#### Missing Platform Support - 2025-08-25
- **Unknown Platforms**: Added missing pattern mappings for Atomiswave and Cannonball platforms
- **Root Cause**: Missing entries in `PLATFORM_MAPPINGS` dictionary and display name mappings
- **Solution**: Added regex patterns and display names for both platforms

#### Directory Scanning Logic - Previous
- **Unknown Platforms**: Fixed processing individual game subdirectories as potential platforms (310+ false positives)
- **Root Cause**: `os.walk()` recursively scanning ALL directories including game subdirectories
- **Solution**: Modified to process only top-level directories as potential platforms
