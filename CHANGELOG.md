All notable changes to the DAT to Shortcode Converter project are documented here.
This format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [0.12.7] - 2025-08-29

### Improved
- **Phase 2 Output**: Removed misleading estimated processing time display that couldn't account for system performance variations, I/O bottlenecks, or hardware differences

## [0.12.6] - 2025-08-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Silent File Overwrites in Concurrent Processing** - Fixed fatal bug where files with identical names from different source folders were silently overwriting each other, causing data loss
- **Enhanced Pattern Matching** - Added missing NES abbreviation patterns to recognize folders like "Nintendo - NES (USA)" that were previously showing as unknown platforms  
- **SHA1 Duplicate Detection** - Implemented comprehensive SHA1 verification to detect truly identical files vs name collisions with different content
- **Intelligent File Renaming** - Added smart folder hint extraction for meaningful rename patterns (e.g., "Mario (USA).nes", "Mario (Europe).nes")

### Technical Improvements
- **Thread-Safe Duplicate Handling**: Added global_target_paths tracking with locks to prevent filename collisions across concurrent threads
- **Pattern Safety**: Used regex word boundaries (\bNES\b) to prevent false positives when "NES" appears inside other words like "Genesis" or "Business"
- **Complete SHA1 Integration**: Port of existing WSL2 duplicate handling to concurrent processing path with identical behavior
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Separate tracking for copied vs renamed files with proper count validation
- **Pattern Hierarchy**: Added missing "Nintendo.*Super NES.*" pattern to ensure Super NES folders map to SNES, not fall through to NES

### Previous Issues Resolved
- Files with same names from different folders no longer overwrite each other (prevented 93 file losses in test case)
- "Nintendo - NES" folder variants now properly recognized as NES platform instead of showing as unknown
- File count discrepancies resolved - reported copies now match actual files in target directory  
- True duplicate files detected via SHA1 and skipped appropriately vs different files with same names being renamed

## [0.12.5] - 2025-08-29

- **Windows Defender File Verification** - Enhanced adaptive delays and retry logic for antivirus scanning interference (50ms-200ms based on file size)
- **Progress Display Accuracy** - Fixed progress bar to show actual files being processed rather than total discovered files
- **Incomplete Processing Prevention** - Improved file counting to prevent ~6,000 files being skipped due to incorrect totals

- **Solution**: Precise path comparison using `Path.resolve()` for target directory detection only

#### Missing Platform Support - 2025-08-25
- **Unknown Platforms**: Added missing pattern mappings for Atomiswave and Cannonball platforms
- **Root Cause**: Missing entries in `PLATFORM_MAPPINGS` dictionary and display name mappings
- **Solution**: Added regex patterns and display names for both platforms

#### Directory Scanning Logic - Previous
- **Unknown Platforms**: Fixed processing individual game subdirectories as potential platforms (310+ false positives)
- **Root Cause**: `os.walk()` recursively scanning ALL directories including game subdirectories
- **Solution**: Modified to process only top-level directories as potential platforms

## [0.8.0] - 2025-08-26 (Retroactive)

### Fixed
- **File Count Mismatch Double-Counting Bug**: Fixed critical statistics bug where renamed files were counted both as renamed AND as copied
- **Duplicate Filename Overwriting Bug**: Implemented smart deduplication to prevent data loss from files with identical names
- **Windows Unicode Encoding Errors**: Comprehensive UTF-8 handling throughout the system
- **Directory Contention Bug**: Folder-level threading architecture eliminates concurrent directory access issues
- **0-Byte File Creation**: Atomic file operations with integrity verification

### Added  
- **CRC32 Verification System**: Fast file integrity checking without temp files
- **ModernTerminalDisplay**: Professional multi-panel real-time progress interface
- **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: 90.3% coverage with specialized Good/MAME/FinalBurn handlers
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Six log categories for detailed debugging and monitoring
- **Graceful Shutdown**: CTRL+C handling with proper thread coordination

## Development History Context

This project has undergone significant development to achieve production-ready status with comprehensive ROM collection management capabilities. All major bugs have been resolved through systematic testing and user feedback integration.

### Key Milestones
- **August 2025**: Production-ready release with 100% validation success
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced pattern matching system implementation
- **Phase 1**: Core functionality and basic platform detection

### Known Limitations
- **WSL2 Incompatibility**: High I/O error rates (54%+) on Windows mounts due to 9p protocol limitations
- **Recommendation**: Use native Windows or Linux environments for optimal performance
