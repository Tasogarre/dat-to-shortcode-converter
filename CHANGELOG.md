## [0.9.8] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL HOTFIX**: Fixed fatal `AttributeError: 'EnhancedROMOrganizer' object has no attribute 'logger_analysis'` crash
- Fixed incorrect logger references in debug logging code added in v0.9.7
- Interactive mode debug logging now uses correct `self.analyzer.logger` instead of non-existent `self.logger_analysis`
- Analyze-only mode debug logging now uses correct `analyzer.logger` instead of non-existent `organizer.logger_analysis`

### Technical Details
- Fixed 12 incorrect logger references in interactive mode path (lines 3239-3292)
- Fixed 12 incorrect logger references in analyze-only mode path (lines 3708-3761)
- All debug logging now uses the proper analyzer logger from `self.comprehensive_logger.get_logger('analysis')`
- Maintains backward compatibility while preventing startup crash

**BREAKING CHANGE RESOLVED**: Debug logging functionality now works without AttributeError crashes.

## [0.9.7] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Added enhanced debug logging to BOTH code paths (interactive and analyze-only modes)
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed unknown files count showing 0 in interactive mode - debug output now works in all modes
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed completely misleading "Non-ROM files skipped" label - these are actually ROM files in excluded/unknown platforms

### Enhanced  
- **Interactive Mode Debug**: Enhanced debug logging now works in interactive mode with --debug-analysis flag
- **Label Clarity**: Changed misleading "Non-ROM files skipped" to "Files in excluded/unknown platforms" with explanation
- **Path Construction Debug**: Comprehensive logging of path construction, existence checks, and file counting for unknown directories
- **Complete Transparency**: Debug mode now shows exactly why unknown files count as 0 and what extensions are found

### Technical Details
- Copied comprehensive debug logging from analyze-only path to regular organize_roms path (lines 3228-3297)
- Enhanced debug output works regardless of whether --analyze-only flag is used
- Fixed label confusion: 1,376 "non-ROM files" are actually ROM files (.zip) in excluded (659) + unknown (717) platforms
- Debug mode provides step-by-step path validation and file counting for unknown directories

**BREAKING CHANGE RESOLVED**: Enhanced debugging now works in interactive mode, not just analyze-only mode.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed

#### Threading Errors and CTRL+C Handling - 2025-08-26
- **Threading Type Errors**: Fixed `'str' object has no attribute 'name'` errors flooding terminal during multi-threaded processing
- **Unresponsive CTRL+C**: Added graceful shutdown mechanism with signal handling and progress preservation
- **Root Cause**: Type mismatch in folder path handling and missing signal handler registration
- **Solution**: Path type consistency, defensive handling, Event-based shutdown, thread interruption support

#### File Count Mismatch + Unicode Logging Errors - 2025-08-26
- **File Count Mismatch**: Fixed persistent 1,925 missing files issue (50,519 reported vs 48,594 actual)
- **Unicode Encoding Errors**: Fixed `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character` crashes on Windows
- **Root Cause**: Counter incremented before verification, missing UTF-8 encoding in log handlers
- **Solution**: Post-copy verification, manifest tracking, UTF-8 file logging, Windows path length checking

#### File Count Double-Counting Bug - 2025-08-26
- **Double-Counting**: Fixed renamed files being counted both as renamed AND copied (2,109 file discrepancy)
- **Statistics Issues**: Fixed 0 renamed duplicates despite duplicate-prone filenames in dataset
- **Root Cause**: Lines 1313 and 1351 both incremented counters for same files
- **Solution**: Exclude renamed files from copied count, enhanced logging, improved statistics display

#### Duplicate Filename Overwriting Bug - 2025-08-26
- **Data Loss**: Fixed files with identical names from different folders overwriting each other (1,975 files lost)
- **Root Cause**: `target_file_path = target_platform_dir / source_path.name` created identical paths
- **Solution**: Smart deduplication with `get_unique_target_path()`, folder hint extraction, SHA1 verification

#### Directory Contention Bug - 2025-08-25  
- **Concurrent File Operations**: Fixed race conditions causing 0-byte target files and copy failures
- **Root Cause**: Multiple threads accessing same source directory causing OS-level directory inode locking
- **Solution**: Folder-level threading architecture, atomic file operations, exponential backoff retry logic
- **Impact**: Eliminated 48-53 directory contention events, achieved 0 contention with new method

#### Windows Compatibility Issues - 2025-08-25
- **Missing Implementation**: Fixed placeholder `_process_concurrent()` method returning empty stats
- **Unicode Encoding**: Replaced arrow characters (→) with ASCII (->) to prevent cp1252 errors

- **Data Structure**: Fixed dict structure handling for Path objects in threading methods

#### Directory Filter Logic Bug - 2025-08-25
- **Platform Detection**: Fixed "Found 0 supported platforms" despite valid ROM collections
- **Root Cause**: Overly broad filter pattern matching any directory with "roms" in parent path
- **Solution**: Precise path comparison using `Path.resolve()` for target directory detection only

#### Missing Platform Support - 2025-08-25
- **Unknown Platforms**: Added missing pattern mappings for Atomiswave and Cannonball platforms
- **Root Cause**: Missing entries in `PLATFORM_MAPPINGS` dictionary and display name mappings
- **Solution**: Added regex patterns and display names for both platforms

#### Directory Scanning Logic - Previous
- **Unknown Platforms**: Fixed processing individual game subdirectories as potential platforms (310+ false positives)
- **Root Cause**: `os.walk()` recursively scanning ALL directories including game subdirectories
- **Solution**: Modified to process only top-level directories as potential platforms
